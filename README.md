## Mediawiki-utilities

A collection of dirty (and not so) scripts to manipulate a mediawiki deployment.
Is a job in progress, growing along a ultra personalized mediawiki project, so I will be adding more scripts soon.

## Installation

Each script must be downloaded and put in specific folder, mostly maintenance.
